# Cryo-ET_Mdoc_Management_Scripts
A collection of small scripts to help with editing .mdoc files (for cryoET) in bulk. 


An mdoc file is a text file that collates the metadata of raw frames from a tilt series in tomography. 
Mdoc files are sometimes wrong or have problems associated with them which can cause certain 
pieces of software to have problems parsing the data. 

These scripts were written to solve some of these mdoc-related issues.
